He is not using the masses to calculate the impulse, as mentioned in the post's code block (it's different from the actual P5 code).

We shouldn't use the particle's masses for the repulsion, but their radix(?).

Improvements for the particle version with grid lookup (from https://www.gorillasun.de/blog/particle-system-optimization-grid-lookup-spatial-hashing/):
* We only need to check for collision with the canvas boundaries if the particle is in one of the grid cells located at the border of the grid.
* [already implemented] We also only need to update a particle's grid cell if it's new position falls into a new grid cell.
