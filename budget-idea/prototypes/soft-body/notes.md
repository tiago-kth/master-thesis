He is not using the masses to calculate the impulse, as mentioned in the post's code block (it's different from the actual P5 code).

We shouldn't use the particle's masses for the repulsion, but their radix(?).

Improvements for the particle version with grid lookup (from https://www.gorillasun.de/blog/particle-system-optimization-grid-lookup-spatial-hashing/):
* We only need to check for collision with the canvas boundaries if the particle is in one of the grid cells located at the border of the grid.
* [already implemented] We also only need to update a particle's grid cell if it's new position falls into a new grid cell.

* Usar B√©zier em vez de linhas? `quadraticCurveTo(cpx, cpy, x, y)`

`(cpx, cpy)` poderiam ser encontrados usando `[ (pa - pcenter) + (pb - pcenter) ] * c`, onde `c > 1/2` (`c = 1/2` posicionaria o ponto de controle no ponto m√©dio dos dois pontos). Fazer interativo.

Particle system seems to be working. Going to try implementing the spring-mass system.

Worked. But not the circular structures.

> It kind of blows my mind that with relatively little such an interesting system emerges. The beauty of emergence: the mesh doesn't really know that it exists, it's simply the particles and springs working in tandem to create this intricate and dynamic structure.

Back to work.

Trying to build the grid lookup for the spatial hashing.

Playing with some of the parameters, those will be fundamental to achieve the visual effect we're aiming at.

For lower time-steps, we need lower (meaning, stronger) velocity damping to help stabilize the system. Time steps of 50 seem to work well.

## 2024.04.10

Higher stiffness make the blobs blobbier when under contact.

Gas constant and stiffness constant impact in the final blob size compared to its reference circle.

## 2024.04.11

Building the collision system. Based on Millington, chapter 7. Thinking if I need to iterate over all particles or over all cells, and whether that makes any difference.

Collisions with rods / springs? Not on this version.

Smaller radius seem more unstable for lower time steps.

Parametrizar particle radius.

No collision detection, ignorar as part√≠culas adjacentes. Talvez adicionar √≠ndice √†s part√≠culas.

Experimentar com mais springs tamb√©m.

Rela√ß√£o time_step x velocity damping. Smaller blobs seem more instable, but increasing the time step makes them stabilize, just like reducing the velocity damping factor (thus increasing the damping) would.

Calcula theta de acordo com R do blob e r das part√≠culas. E depois recalcula o theta para ficar perfeito.

Time_step 70 parece funcionar bem.

Como evitar emaranhados?

Melhorar a hist√≥ria de colorir os colliders.

Larger colliders would avoid the problem of particles traversing each other, or traversing the boundaries...

"In an essence, yes. But there are some tricks that happen during the collision detection, like offsetting the colliders based on the surface normals and some other factors." (https://x.com/JuhaniHalkomaki/status/1727620541316534351)

Tentando evitar micro-vibra√ß√µes. Aplicando esse conceito de "RESTING CONTACTS", do Millington (7.2.3). Calculando a velocidade da part√≠cula devido √† aplica√ß√£o da acelera√ß√£o em um frame, se for maior do que a velocidade atual, √© por causa desse problema de resting contacts. Mas n√£o est√° elegante, melhorar.

A solu√ß√£o anterior funcionou, mas depende do coeficiente de restitui√ß√£o, de acordo com os tamanhos das part√≠culas.
DT tamb√©m tem influ√™ncia na vibra√ß√£o.

Experimentando uma nova forma de intera√ß√£o. Criar uma part√≠cula, uma nova classe?

Juhani, no Instagram
> the same effect could be achieved using available physics libraries. But I like to understand things and to solve puzzles. Figuring it out on my own checks both of these boxes.

Pr√≥ximos passos: 

1. Testar colliders maiores com offset. Vai permitir controlar a separa√ß√£o entre os blobs e evitar interpenetra√ß√£o de um blob em outro.
2. Criar uma estrutura de visualiza√ß√£o propriamente dita... calcular escalas de √°reas conforme um conjunto de dados, labels etc.
3. Fazer um interativo para testar diferentes tipos de contorno dos blobs.
4. Criar uma part√≠cula na posi√ß√£o do mouse.
5. Remover top boundary

# 2024.04.16

O que √© estranho √© que quando o sistema come√ßa a demonstrar instabilidade, vc aumenta o time step, ele estabilizar, e depois vc reduz de novo e ele continua est√°vel.

Talvez incluir um contador, e, toda vez que houver intera√ß√£o, zerar o contador. Depois que chegar na quantidade de itera√ß√µes, parar a simula√ß√£o. Fiz um exemplo num commit, pode funcionar.

# 2024.04.20

Depois da reuni√£o com Bj√∂rn: avalia√ß√£o. Engagement questionnaire.

Implements new colliders. 

```js
    update_collider_position() {

        this.collider_radius = params.COLLIDERS_RADIUS >= (this.blob_radius + this.r) ? this.blob_radius + this.r : params.COLLIDERS_RADIUS; 
        const distance_from_blob_center = this.blob_radius + this.r  - this.collider_radius;
        const unit_radial_vector = Vec.sub(this.pos, this.blob_center).getUnitDir();
        this.collider_center = Vec.add(
            this.blob_center, 
            Vec.mult(unit_radial_vector, distance_from_blob_center + this.r)
        );

        //console.log(distance_from_blob_center, this.r, this.blob_center, this.collider_radius, this.collider_center);

    }
```

When determining the collisions, we should stop in the first collision, because we'll have many simultaneous collisions with the big colliders.

In the way I am implementing it, the collider will always be positioned according to the blob center. But we want it according to the particle position instead! We must calculate it position from the particle position. It should be `p + (p_r - c_r) unit_radial_vector`.

To-do:

* Testar colliders internos (que na verdade v√£o ficar meio externos)
* Calcular normais para cada v√©rtice / part√≠cula
* Ver na Biblioteca acesso ao Dagens Nyheter.

A intera√ß√£o at√© que est√° funcionando de forma interessante, pq se vc move muito r√°pido a "part√≠cula" de intera√ß√£o entra no blob e come√ßa a pux√°-lo.

Implementar uma forma de escolher o tipo de intera√ß√£o?

Resolver esse problema do grid. Talvez criar mais c√©lulas fantasma al√©m dos limites.

2024-05-01

Resolvido isso "Resolver esse problema do grid. Talvez criar mais c√©lulas fantasma al√©m dos limites.". O problema eram as springs que ficam com tamanho igual a zero.

Agora tem um problema de mover muito r√°pido a part√≠cula de intera√ß√£o. Mas n√£o trava a simula√ß√£o.

Stuff in the template:

\section{Template Overview}

This document will \emph{not} explain all the major features of the \verb|acmart| document
class, but will focus on the features of the \verb|timtm| document
class. The \verb|timtm| document
class is purposely similar to the \verb|acmart| document
class, thus facilitating your submitting your report to an ACM conference\footnote{Simply change the document class from timtm to acmart. This sample document conditionally redefines some commands and an environment - so that the features added for a degree project are not included in the resulting document.}. For further information about the details of the \verb|acmart| document
class, see the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide} --- 
available from \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}.

The primary parameter given to the document class is
the {\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication. This parameter is enclosed in square
brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[STYLE]{timtm}
\end{verbatim}

The styles relevant for a degree project report include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|sigcconf|}: The majority of ACM's conference proceedings use the {\verb|sigcconf|} template style, as will a degree project report for the Interactive Media Technology (TIMTM) and Media Management (TMMTM) programmes. However, as the class file has been optimized for these two programs, you do not have to give the option: {\verb|sigcconf|}. If you are going to submit to an ACM conference, then you should remove the KTH cover, title, page, DiVA information, Swedish abstract \& keywords, etc. and change to the sigconf document class.
\item {\verb|screen|}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
\item {\verb|review|}: Includes line numbers.
\item {\verb|manuscript|}: Generally used in conjunction with \verb|review| to make it easy for a copy editor to work with your document.
\end{itemize}

A good second step in using the template is to modify the contents of the \texttt{custom\_configuration.tex} file. It contains a number of commands that configure the template as sell as provide meta data that will be needed when your degree project has been successfully completed and your grades are reported in LADOK and the degree project report is archived in DiVA. If you want to understand the motivation for this information and the underlying details of the template see the Overleaf project \url{https://www.overleaf.com/read/qxvttmmqbgdt}. The meta data is collected and appears on a page or pages and the end of the document. These pages will be removed before the report is archived in DiVA.


\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

There are \verb|alttitle| and \verb|altsubtitle| commands so that you can easily specify a Swedish title and optionally a Swedish subtitle for your report. Note that both the thesis title and the Swedish thesis title will subsequently be entered as meta data in DiVA and in LADOK.

\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.

The ACM Computing Classification System  (CCS) ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
the research being presented.

There is a \verb|SwedishKeywords| command to make it easy to add keywords in Swedish for your report. These can help make your report visible if someone searches for one or more of these Swedish keywords. You should order them in the same order that you entered the English keywords.

For ACM submissions, CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts). For degree projects is is very desirable that you provide a suitable set of keywords to help potential readers find your thesis in DiVA.


\section{Tables}

The document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Danish, Faroese, and Norwegian names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
more easily.


\section{Language, Style, and Content}

Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consistently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Use common and basic vocabulary (e.g., use the word ``unusual'' rather than the word ``arcane''.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your
  text---e.g., ``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''. You might want to use the package \texttt{glossaries} to help with this.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., ``1--5--97'' or
  ``5/1/97'' may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may
  mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences:
  ``Participants were paid {\fontfamily{txr}\selectfont \textwon}
  25,000, or roughly US \$22.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years). See the
  \textit{Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal
  attributes~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF}. Be particularly aware of
  considerations around writing about people with disabilities.  See also ACM Diversity and Inclusion Council's web page on ``Words Matter: Alternatives for Charged Terminology in the Computing Profession''~\cite{ACMdiversity}.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Nguy{\~{\^{e}}}n,
  Universit{\"a}t, Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).
  These characters are already included in most versions and variants
  of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.
\end{itemize}
